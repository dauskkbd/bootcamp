            In honour of this, they began to create a new city atop the ruins of
            these tombs. What better place to create a city than directly above
            the ruins of a previous great civilisation? In honour of the most
            potently-blooded queen of the Pthumerians, the city was named
            Yharnam. With that naming, it too became cursed to follow in the
            footsteps of many of those prior civilisations. In search of greater
            enlightenment, many scholars of Byrgenwerth became enchanted by the
            idea that eyes on the inside were required, to see the world in a
            way that was impossible naturally. Seeking this goal, they
            discovered an orphaned Great One upon the shore of a small Fishing
            Hamlet, and slaughtered the village for their, in their view,
            blessed eyes.

      <h1 class="header">The Complete Story and Secrets Unveiled</h1>
      <p class="fs-5">
        Our eyes are yet to open, fear the old blood - master willem and
        laurence These were the words spoken between
        <a href="">Master Willem</a> and <a href="">Laurence</a>, from the
        cautious teacher to the ambitious student. Fear what you do not
        understand, fear the old blood. And so our story begins with blood;
        ancient blood. Deep below the city of Yharnam lies the ancient
        underground labyrinth of Pthumery. It is known as the Chalice of
        Dungeons. The old labyrinth was carved out by the Pthumerians , super
        human being that was said to have discovered a sinister truth. The
        hunters had another name for the labyrinth, they called it the Tomb of
        the Gods, for below, they found traces of god-like beings named The
        Great Ones. <br /><br />

        The Great Ones could function on transcendental planes of thought,
        meaning they have elevated their consciousness beyond the physical
        realm. The benefits of operating on this plane are unclear. Perhaps it
        was in the name of immortality, or perhaps power, as even beyond, The
        Great Ones could interfere with beings and events in the waking world.
        Whatever the case it is clear that some kind of ascension took place as
        there are numerous references to some that are left behind. Of all the
        strange life forms that reside in the nooks and crannies of the
        labyrinth, the slugs are clear signs of the left-behind Great Ones. One
        such Great One appears to be abandoned <a href="">Ebrietas</a>, a
        left-behind being who apparently did not ascend with her brethren. One
        day, Ebrietas would be discovered by the humans above in a crusade with
        a character named Willem. <br /><br />

        Master Willem presided over a prestigious place of learning,
        <a href=""> Byrgenwerth</a>, situated by a tranquil lake and secluded in
        a gigantic forest. Byrgenwerth housed the minds that would change the
        world. In fact, everything sacred in Yharnam came to be traced back to
        Byrgenwerth, including the most influential characters within the story,
        namely, Master Willem, Runesmith Caryll, Laurence,
        <a href="">Micolash</a>, and <a href="">Gherman</a>. <br /><br />

        Master WIllem was the head of the school at Byrgenwerth; the man was
        obsessed with the truth and believed in pushing the limits of humanity.
        In every dialogue and description, he was referred to as Master or
        Provost, clearly deserving of a great deal of respect. Many would
        eventually diverge from his tutelage but few can say that they didn;t
        owe everything to his research, for while Willem presided in
        Byrgenwerth, the scholars there discovered terrific things in the tombs,
        below the city of Yharnam. “Once a group of young Byrgenwerth scholars
        discovered a holy medium deep within the tomb. This led to the founding
        of the <a href="">Healing Church</a> and the establishment of blood
        healing. it's hard to be sure exactly what was found, but we do know it
        was related to the Great Ones. On the ground floor of Byrgenwerth
        College, we find the Pearl Slug, remnants of the Great Ones, and at the
        very top of the college, we find the Empty Phantasm Shell, an empty
        invertebrate shell that is said to be the familiar of the Great One.
        After this discovery, whatever it was that showed them that the Great
        Ones existed, the Byrgenwerth scholars launched an inquiry into the
        great ones and the old blood. <br /><br />

        The second character, Runesmith Caryll, a student of Byrgenwerth,
        transcribed inhuman utterings of the Great Ones into what are now called
        Caryll Runes. In true Lovecraftain fashion, it is unlikely for humans to
        comprehend the speech of the Great Ones; but Caryll apparently had a
        knack, a talent for creating a visual representation of the Great One's
        words. The hunter who retreives this workshop tool can etch Caryll runes
        into their mind to attain wondrous strength. Provost Willem would have
        been proud of Caryll's runes, as they do not rely upon blood in any
        measure. <br /><br />

        This statement tells us three things; first, Provost Willem and Caryll
        were close, as Willem would have been proud of him; second, Willem
        didn't have the chance to be proud, so it's possible that the two lost
        contact; and thirdly, Willem would have been proud because the runes did
        not rely on blood. In other words, Willem did not approve the use of the
        old blood, the blood found in the Tomb of the Gods. The 'Metamorphosis'
        rune states, "the discover of blood made their dreams of evolution a
        reality". Metamorphosis, and the excesses and deviation that followed,
        was only the beginning. Willem believed in a different path. He believed
        in attaining more insight, for humanity's eyes had yet to open. The
        'Eye' rune states that 'Master Willem looked to beings from higher
        planes for guidance, and sought to line his brain with eyes in order to
        elevate his thoughts.' <br /><br />

        With the discovery of beings greater than them, came a desire to ascend
        into Godhood, to push humanity into it's next stage of evolution. The
        only question was 'how'? Blood, or insight? And this was a question that
        split the ranks of the Byrgenwerth Scholars, in which Master Willem and
        his student Laurance parted ways. 'Master Willem, I've come to bid you
        farewell', says Laurnce. 'Oh, I know, I know' replied Master Willem,
        'you think now to betray me.' Laurence was regarded as a high ranking
        student, that Master Willem believed that this 'departure' is an act of
        betrayal. 'No', says Laurence, 'but you will never listen.' Essentially,
        their disagreement boils down to the difference of what they believed
        in. Willem believes that man requires insight and knowledge to ascend.
        Laurence, believes in the power of blood. Laurence attempted to reassure
        Willem, telling him he will always fear the old blood, but that this
        fear will not stop him from using it. 'I tell you, I will not forget our
        adage.'. Master Willem answers, 'We are born of the blood, made men by
        the blood, undone by the blood. Our eyes are yet to open, fear the old
        blood.' Laurence replies finallym 'I must take my leave.' <br /><br />

        Laurence leaves the Byrgenwerth scholars, presumably with a small group
        of rebels and goes on to found the Healing Church. Willem remains in
        Byrgenwerth and attemps to elevate his thoughts to a higher plane.
        Everything Laurence would come to achieve was based on the knowledge he
        had come by in Byrgenwerth. In retrospect, we clearly see, while Willem
        saw Laurence's departure as a betrayal, perhaps Willem himself planted
        these ideas in Laurence's mind. A note in the lecture hall reads,
        'Master Willem was right. Evolution without courage will be the ruin of
        our race.' Laurence had courage, but it is likely that this courage.
        bordered on arrogance. The Byrgenwerth student uniform states, 'The
        Healing Church has its roots in Byrgenwerth, and naturally burrows
        heavily from its uniform design. The focus, not on knowledge, or
        thought, but on pure pretension would surely bring Master Willem to
        despair, if only he knew. So Laurance threw caution to the wind and put
        his faith in the old blood.<br /><br />

        Think on human history; imagine if in any era, a church was founded that
        had access to a substance that could cure any illness. Imagine if this
        church gave it freely to a city. How powerful that city would become,
        how powerful the church would become within it. This is exactly what
        happened in Yharnam. People came from far and wide, to be treated with
        the miraculous Blood of the Gods and the people of Yharnam put their
        faith in the Healing Church. In fact, what happened in Yharnam is eerily
        similar to what happened in the tombs below, where the blood was
        originally found. Many chalice dungeons, especially those of Loran, are
        now overrun buy horrific beasts. The lower Loran chalice states: 'There
        are trace remains of medical procedure in parts of ailing Loran. Whether
        these were attempts to control the scourge of the beast or the cause of
        the outbreak, is unknown.' The Ailing Loran chalice states: 'Th tragedy
        that struck this ailing land of Loran is said to have it's roots in the
        scourge of the beast. Some have made the dreaded extrapolation that
        Yharnam maybe next.<br /><br />
        Yharnam was next. <br /><br />

        Through overuse of the healing blood, the city would eventually succumb
        to the scourge of the beast. Until then though, Laurence and the Healing
        Church managed to grow in power, with the miraculous healing properties
        of their special yet infected blood. Yharnam grew to become a city of
        worship and fear. As the hunter explores throughout the city, you see
        the influence of the church everywhere. With Yharnam's resources,
        Laurnece clearly had the power to grow the church beyond what would have
        been possible at Byrgenwerth. All the while he continued exploring the
        labyrinth from below Yharnam. The tomb prospector set reads: 'Attire of
        the tomb prospectors who explore the old labyrinth on behalf of the
        Healing Church. The Healing Church traces its roots to Byrgenwerth, and
        is therefore aware of the ruins' true importance. They contain much more
        than mere hunter trinkets, indeed, they hide the very secrets of the old
        Great Ones, sought after by those with the insight to imagine greatness'
        On top of this, Laurence split the church into multiple branches, each
        with a different purpose. There was the Choir, The School of Mensis, and
        the Workshop. The main purpose the church , at leastt to the people of
        Yharnam,was the administration of blood healing. Within the Grand
        Cathedral itself lies a note that says: 'Heir to the ritual of blood,
        purveyor of ministration. Place your hand on the altar's sacred
        covering, and inscribed Master Laurence's adage upon your flesh.
        <br /><br />

        Blood ministers would have been those who administed blood healing. How
        else would the people of Yharnam be obsessed with blood? In Yharnam,
        they produced more blood than alchohol, as the former is more
        intoxicating. However, the ministration of blood was likely a means to
        an end, for the Healing church still intended to commune with the Great
        Ones in hopes of ascending humanity to a higher plane. This task was
        given to the Choir, a group who were part of the Healing Church. Members
        of the Choir are both the highest ranking cleric of the healing church
        and the scholars who continue the work that began at Byrgenwerth. The
        eye-covering indicates their debt to the teachings of Master Willem,
        even though their paths diverged. The Choir, garbed in black and white
        with a familiar white covering, occupied the
        <a href="">Upper Cathedral Ward</a>. It seems to have been their job to
        research and make contact with the Great Ones. The Great Isz Chalice
        became the cornerstone of the Choir, the elite delegation of the Healing
        Church. It was also the first Great Chalice brought back to the surface
        since the time of Byrgenwerth, and allowed the Choir to have an audience
        with Ebrietas. <br /><br />

        Ebrietas was the left- behind Great One who came to reside below the
        Grand Cathedral We are tld that the Grand Cathedral is the birthplace of
        the Healing Church's special blood. And if the church were using the
        blood of the Great Ones, then who's to say it wasn't Ebrietas blood? The
        augur of Ebrietas is one of the secret rights of the Choir, used by the
        high-ranking members of the healing church. 'Use phantasms, the
        invertebrates known to be the augurs of the Great Ones, to partially
        summon abandoned Ebrietas.'. One of the few rights that allow one to
        directly utilize the power of the Great Ones and evidence that the choir
        had approached the Eldritch Truth. The augur of Ebrietas was an arcane
        method of fighting that was actually shared with the second subsection
        of the Healing Church, the School of Mensis. The upper echelon of the
        Healing Church were formed the School of Mensis based in the Unseen
        Village, and the Choir occupying the Cathedral Ward. <br /><br />

        The third character, <a href="">Micolash</a>. He was likely the head of
        the School of Mensis. As the school name implies, it was a place
        learning, research and experimentation. Their student set reads: The
        Healing Church has its roots in Byrgenwerth, and naturally burrows
        heavily from its uniform design. The school was based on Yharnam in a
        place called Yahar'gul, the Unseen Village. Clearly, the Work of Mensis
        was intended to be kept a secret from the people of Yharnam. In fact, as
        time went on, the School incresingly seems to have been working alone,
        even separately from the Healing Church. The Yahar'gul attire tells us:
        'The Hunters of Yahar'gul answer to the village's founders, the School
        of Mensis. Hunter in name only, these kidnappers blend into the night
        wearing this attire.' These were not true Hunters, that title was saved
        for the third subsection of the Healing Church , the Hunters of the
        Workshop. These capable warriors of the church appeared as the scourge
        of the beast began to show in Yharnam. <br /><br />

        The Workshop Hunters served under
        <a href="">Gherman, the first Hunter,</a> The Hunter attire reads: 'One
        of the standard articles of hunter attire fashioned at the workshop,
        accompanied with a short cape to wipe away blood. A fine piece of hunter
        attrire that provides stable defence to anyone facing Yharnam's beastly
        threat
