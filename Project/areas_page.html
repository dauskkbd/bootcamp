            The Hunter's Dream is an otherworldly replica of the original
            Hunter's Workshop, now called the Abandoned Old Workshop under the
            Healing Church Workshop. Created by Gehrman and the Moon Presence,
            the Hunter's Dream was originally intended as a way to ensure there
            were always hunters to fight the beasts. Gehrman eventually realized
            that the Dream was bound to his consciousness, with each requiring
            the existence of the other, and nearly went mad from the revelation
            of never dying yet serving an eternal cause.<span

            Cathedral Ward is a large district that serves as the primary base
            of operations for the Healing Church, it is home to some of the
            Church's more powerful members, such as the Church Giants and Church
            Servants. On the Night of the Hunt, the gates of the Ward close as
            hunters venture out to combat the Beasts. Navigating through the
            streets of Cathedral Ward is time consuming, mostly because it is a
            place that has many streets and paths to other locations,
            constituting what is easily the largest part of Yharnam's city. This
            area is often confused with Oedon Chapel, due to the lamp being
            located in it, having the title of "Cathedral Ward". In reality,
            Oedon Chapel is a tiny safe haven that is merely a speck of what
            constitutes the Cathedral Ward itself.<span

            Old Yharnam is an abandoned district located in the valleys of
            Yharnam. Since the town was set to flame long ago, most buildings
            are in a decaying state and the town is currently inhabited by
            dangerous Beasts and a venerable old hunter named Djura. Old Yharnam
            still exhibits the aftermath of its final hunt and has several
            crucified beasts on the streets, set ablaze to send a a warning to
            the Beasts. It is in such dangerous terrible state now that none
            dare to enter this forsaken town. The final hunt of Old Yharnam is
            featured in the first issue of Bloodborne: The Death of Sleep, which
            portrays the city being engulfed in an inferno ravished with beasts
            and hunters alike.<span

            many broken and unlit rafters. One might wonder what abandoned old
            secrets still lie within, away from prying eyes. Regardless, there
            are many Huntsmen who guard the place, in particular the very top of
            the workshop, which connects to the elusive Upper Cathedral
            Ward.<span

            Through Oedon Chapel one can find the Healing Church Workshop which
            hides away the upper echelons of the Healing Church, in a mysterious
            place called, Upper Cathedral Ward, home of the Choir. However, this
            home is nothing but a giant gate that locks away the most terrible
            secret of the Healing Church. For through the Lumenflower Gardens,
            one reaches deep into the depths of the Grand Cathedral only to find
            a giant chamber. The crumbled and waterlogged remains of a Chalice
            Dungeon known as Great Isz. And there, in the distance, lies
            Ebrietas, Daughter of the Cosmos. Mourning the mouldy corpse of a
            deceased spider, not unlike Rom, that was crushed by the
            rubble.<span

          <p>
            Hemwick Charnel Lane is one of several districts in Yharnam. As its
            name indicates, it is essentially a mass grave that follows a
            direct, straight road, though the player will have to unlock the
            main street by exploring the sidepaths. The place seems to have been
            locked to prevent the Scourge of Beasts from infecting the area, as
            the forest at the entrance to the Charnel Lane is protected by
            Huntsmen and Hunting Dogs, in order to prevent any beast from
            traversing the gate. Inside Hemwick it becomes quickly apparent that
            this small village is obsessed with the handling of the deceased.
            Many tiny houses with chimneys resemble crematoriums, and there are
            many guillotines to cut the bodies into pieces. Meanwhile, the crows
            feast as multiple crosses are raised with corpses on them so they
            are disfleshed and likely easier to handle.<span

            An old abandoned workshop that bears a remarkable resemblance to the

          <p>
            Forsaken Cainhurst Castle is the giant castle belonging to the
            Cainhurst Vilebloods, now abandoned to time, and covered in snow and
            ice, following the raid of the Executioners who slaughtered their
            inhabitants mercilessly, leaving only the servants alive.
            Interestingly, the Castle grounds, halls and chambers are completely
            permeated by four identical statues. What makes them interesting is
            that only one of the statues is male, while the other three are
            representative of women. The great, ruined castle is comprised of a
            large patium filled with ice and dead trees that appears to have
            catastrophically collapsed under its own weight. A great hall filled
            with servants that clean the floors and pillars of the luxurious
            castle; a dining room, with the most luscious silverware decorating
            the tables can be seen, as well as a large amount of portraits of
            royalty are exposed on the walls. But the most important part of
            this decadent construction is the gigantic library that has an
            unimaginable size, truly colossal and likely an indication of the
            history and elitist and refined standards of the Vilebloods.<span

            When Micolash and the School of Mensis sought an audience with
            Mergo, they would likely never believe the events that would have
            transpired from it. The sacrifice of their own physical bodies was
            needed to project their minds into the realm of nightmares, but that
            sacrifice served their needs and bore its fruits. This realm was
            hosted by none other than Micolash, and it was by his own design or
            want that the Nightmare of Mensis came to be.<span
