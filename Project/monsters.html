          <p>
            Amygdala are Great Ones that appear to be some of the most
            widely-revered of their kind. This is indicated by the numerous
            statues of them lining the Cathedral Ward and Yahar'gul, Unseen
            Village. A much larger statue, which appears to be part of a shrine,
            is located in the church of the Hypogean Gaol. Many Amygdala
            populate the world, dwelling atop the sides of various large
            buildings. One Amygdala came to inhabit an area in the Nightmare
            Frontier known as Amygdala's Chamber. Patches the Spider is
            seemingly one of the most devoted of this Amygdala's worshippers and
            offers sacrifices to his "God" through the use of the Tonsil Stone,
            transporting them into the Nightmare Frontier. However, after The
            Hunter slays the Amygdala, he expressed no remorse or anger, merely
            believing they "bestowed salvation" upon the entity.

          <p>
            It is suggested that the Blood-starved Beast was a person receiving
            blood healing as a part of rituals performed by Healing Church
            members in Old Yharnam in order to learn more about the Great Ones
            and the effects of blood healing. This is demonstrated by a corpse
            of another Blood-Starved Beast can be found crucified and chained in
            the small chapel of Old Yharnam. Moreover, below the corpse, the
            Hunter finds ritual blood. This suggests that the Blood-starved
            Beast has some connection to ritualistic practices performed by the
            Healing Church and has some significance to Blood-Healing and its
            administration. In this case, it is well possible that these Beasts
            "must" be skinned alive in order to collect their blood without
            killing them, since they would simply regenerate minor cuts or
            surgical shunts.

          <p>
            Lore While there is very little information on it, this Great One is
            revealed in the DLC to have been created by experimentation by the
            Healing Church, who used the orphans they captured as a sort of
            think tank[1]. They would have their patients imbibe in water,
            apparently infested with otherworldly microscopic life that
            congealed the brain fluid (taken as the generation of the "eyes on
            the inside"), and listen for the sound of the ocean due to the Great
            Ones being linked to it by the Church in the past[2]. This would
            present itself in the form of a sort of "sticky" sound, which was
            labeled as the sound of water said to come from the depths of the
            ocean, and was thought to be the voice of a sort of celestial
            attendant that guided those with enough brain fluid "eyes" to
            revelation[3]. Most of the patients did not survive with sanity,
            driven mad by the feeling of drowning, and becoming convinced that
            they had failed. They would plead for the forgiveness and help of
            Maria, an old hunter the lived in the clocktower nearby, and was in
            charge of patient care. She tried to comfort them by allowing them
            access to the Lumenflower Gardens nearby, and although it worked for
            some, most could not comprehend why she would care for their well
            being after what was going on.[4] Those that imbibed the water were
            deformed by the process of the body acclimating to the situation,
            such as increase in size, thinning of the body, and the heads
            expanding into blank, unseeing masses of flesh. Rarely their heads
            would develop tentacles in their heads, which emerged painfully but
            could be self induced, which caused Frenzy in lifeforms that they
            touched. Some where able to access cosmic power of Kin, but even
            they went mad and were left in the gardens, the calm of which was
            likely how they remained sane enough to ascend even that far.
            Eventually there were those who became so enlightened by what the
            celestial attendant said that they grew to immense size, gained blue
            flesh with gender neutral bodies, and could harness raw cosmic
            fields to Great One levels of power. But even those patients,
            despite the calm of the lumenwood plant that they attended, were
            unable to remain sane and their heads collapsed in on themselves
            while their power was unstable. They were left in the garden above
            the lumenflowers, with a large lumenwood plant in the center, and
            left to be living failures. It can be surmised then that the
            Celestial Emissary, whomever it once was, maintained their sanity
            long enough to comprehend the cosmos and become a Great One of the
            most legitimate sort. Once they figured out how to properly, the
            Church was likely the ones to produce Kin of the sort that the
            patients in the garden became, and to this day they remained in the
            garden. This entire area is thought to have been the Orphanage
            officially, where the new Great One and the other Kin acted as the
            Church's font of high level contemplation, and made communication
            with Ebrietas.

          <p>
            The Cleric Beast owes its name to a rumor that it was originally a
            member of Yharnam's clergy transformed by the old blood. After the
            hunter kills the Cleric Beast, he obtains the Sword Hunter Badge
            which states in its description: "One of the badges crafted by the
            Healing Church. The silver sword is a symbol of a Church hunter.
            Ludwig was the first of many Healing Church hunters to come, many of
            Whom were clerics. As it was, clerics transformed into the most
            hideous beasts." This suggests that the Cleric Beast was a member of
            the Healing Church and possibly a hunter employed under Ludwig that
            succumbed to the scourge of the beast, leading to their descent into
            beasthood.

            creature that resembles a slug with squid-like tentacles emerging
            from her back. Her face appears split in half and is covered in
            strange growths that resemble fungus that surround her vulnerable
            head (only red flesh is seen, so it is possible that she has no real
            mouth) but, despite being a Kin (most of them have bulging and
            globular yellow eyes), she has only two oval shaped green eyes.
            Ebrietas also possesses a set of skeletal wings that grant her
            limited flight. The object of the Healing Church's worship, Ebrietas
            communes only with the highest members of the Church, guiding them
            in the ways of Blood Ministration. She is one of the Great Ones who
            was left behind in the old labyrinth, eventually discovered by the
            Healing Church. The Healing Church later founded the Choir to
            protect and study her. She is the only Great One that wants to
            coexist with humans.

            Father Gascoigne is an experienced hunter who has succumbed to the

            frenzied killing spree. He is armed with the Hunter Axe and a
            modified version of the Hunter Pistol. Gascoigne was a priest in a
            foreign land, where he earned the title of "Father". At some point
            in his life, Gascoigne travelled to Yharnam and eventually joined
            the Healing Church as a hunter. From here, Gascoigne was partnered
            with Henryk, an older hunter. The two made an effective duo, and
            their partnership led to Henryk's 'tragically' long life. During his
            final hunt, Gascoigne finally succumbed to the bloodlust, becoming
            little more than the beasts he had hunted.

            that attempted to make contact with the Great Ones. The Mensis Cage
            placed on one's head traps the thoughts of its bearer, and upon

            One of the Great Ones in Bloodborne, the Moon Presence controls and
            manipulates all that resides within the Hunter's Dream. The Moon
            Presence's origin is largely unknown, but its first known appearance
            to humanity was to Laurence, who summoned it for unknown reasons.
            Evidenced by the note located on the upper floor of the Lecture
            Building, the Moon Presence also has a connection to Paleblood.

            Born from an unholy Pthumerian ritual which used the bodies of
            Yharnam's populace, The One Reborn is an amalgamate of grotesque
            misshapen and decayed body parts assembled to form one massive
            unliving creature. The One Reborn seems to be the final, presumably
            failed result of an unholy experiment made in Yahar'gul with the
            intention of ascending humankind to the status of the Great Ones.

          <p>
            Forsaken Cainhurst Castle is the giant castle belonging to the
            Cainhurst Vilebloods, now abandoned to time, and covered in snow and
            ice, following the raid of the Executioners who slaughtered their
            inhabitants mercilessly, leaving only the servants alive.
            Interestingly, the Castle grounds, halls and chambers are completely
            permeated by four identical statues. What makes them interesting is
            that only one of the statues is male, while the other three are
            representative of women. The great, ruined castle is comprised of a
            large patium filled with ice and dead trees that appears to have
            catastrophically collapsed under its own weight. A great hall filled
            with servants that clean the floors and pillars of the luxurious
            castle; a dining room, with the most luscious silverware decorating
            the tables can be seen, as well as a large amount of portraits of
            royalty are exposed on the walls. But the most important part of
            this decadent construction is the gigantic library that has an
            unimaginable size, truly colossal and likely an indication of the
            history and elitist and refined standards of the Vilebloods.

            When Micolash and the School of Mensis sought an audience with
            Mergo, they would likely never believe the events that would have
            transpired from it. The sacrifice of their own physical bodies was
            needed to project their minds into the realm of nightmares, but that
            sacrifice served their needs and bore its fruits. This realm was
            hosted by none other than Micolash, and it was by his own design or
            want that the Nightmare of Mensis came to be.
