          <p>
            Amygdala are Great Ones that appear to be some of the most
            widely-revered of their kind. This is indicated by the numerous
            statues of them lining the Cathedral Ward and Yahar'gul, Unseen
            Village. A much larger statue, which appears to be part of a shrine,
            is located in the church of the Hypogean Gaol. Many Amygdala
            populate the world, dwelling atop the sides of various large
            buildings. One Amygdala came to inhabit an area in the Nightmare
            Frontier known as Amygdala's Chamber. Patches the Spider is
            seemingly one of the most devoted of this Amygdala's worshippers and
            offers sacrifices to his "God" through the use of the Tonsil Stone,
            transporting them into the Nightmare Frontier. However, after The
            Hunter slays the Amygdala, he expressed no remorse or anger, merely
            believing they "bestowed salvation" upon the entity.

          <p>
            It is suggested that the Blood-starved Beast was a person receiving
            blood healing as a part of rituals performed by Healing Church
            members in Old Yharnam in order to learn more about the Great Ones
            and the effects of blood healing. This is demonstrated by a corpse
            of another Blood-Starved Beast can be found crucified and chained in
            the small chapel of Old Yharnam. Moreover, below the corpse, the
            Hunter finds ritual blood. This suggests that the Blood-starved
            Beast has some connection to ritualistic practices performed by the
            Healing Church and has some significance to Blood-Healing and its
            administration. In this case, it is well possible that these Beasts
            "must" be skinned alive in order to collect their blood without
            killing them, since they would simply regenerate minor cuts or
            surgical shunts.<span

            While there is very little information on it, this Great One is
            revealed in the DLC to have been created by experimentation by the
            Healing Church, who used the orphans they captured as a sort of
            think tank. They would have their patients imbibe in water,
            apparently infested with otherworldly microscopic life that
            congealed the brain fluid (taken as the generation of the "eyes on
            the inside"), and listen for the sound of the ocean due to the Great
            Ones being linked to it by the Church in the past[2]. This would
            present itself in the form of a sort of "sticky" sound, which was
            labeled as the sound of water said to come from the depths of the
            ocean, and was thought to be the voice of a sort of celestial
            attendant that guided those with enough brain fluid "eyes" to
            revelation. Most of the patients did not survive with sanity, driven
            mad by the feeling of drowning, and becoming convinced that they had
            failed. They would plead for the forgiveness and help of Maria, an
            old hunter the lived in the clocktower nearby, and was in charge of
            patient care.

          <p>
            The Cleric Beast owes its name to a rumor that it was originally a
            member of Yharnam's clergy transformed by the old blood. After the
            hunter kills the Cleric Beast, he obtains the Sword Hunter Badge
            which states in its description: "One of the badges crafted by the
            Healing Church. The silver sword is a symbol of a Church hunter.
            Ludwig was the first of many Healing Church hunters to come, many of
            Whom were clerics. As it was, clerics transformed into the most
            hideous beasts." This suggests that the Cleric Beast was a member of
            the Healing Church and possibly a hunter employed under Ludwig that
            succumbed to the scourge of the beast, leading to their descent into
            beasthood.

            strange growths that resemble fungus that surround her vulnerable
            head (only red flesh is seen, so it is possible that she has no real
            mouth) but, despite being a Kin (most of them have bulging and
            globular yellow eyes), she has only two oval shaped green eyes.
            Ebrietas also possesses a set of skeletal wings that grant her
            limited flight. The object of the Healing Church's worship, Ebrietas
            communes only with the highest members of the Church, guiding them
            in the ways of Blood Ministration. She is one of the Great Ones who
            was left behind in the old labyrinth, eventually discovered by the
            Healing Church. The Healing Church later founded the Choir to

            modified version of the Hunter Pistol. Gascoigne was a priest in a
            foreign land, where he earned the title of "Father". At some point
            in his life, Gascoigne travelled to Yharnam and eventually joined
            the Healing Church as a hunter. From here, Gascoigne was partnered
            with Henryk, an older hunter. The two made an effective duo, and
            their partnership led to Henryk's 'tragically' long life. During his
            final hunt, Gascoigne finally succumbed to the bloodlust, becoming
            little more than the beasts he had hunted.<span

          <p>
            Despite her title, Rom resembles a gigantic pillbug rather than an
            arachnid. She has a silverfish-like tail and a bulbous body from
            which plant-like appendages appear to be growing, resembling
            Coldblood Flowers. Her face resembles a chunk of pumice and is
            covered in eyes, suggesting its connection to the Great Ones.<span

            The Shadow of Yharnam consists of three figures shrouded in black
            robes. As the fight progresses they are revealed to have been
            infected with the parasitic snakes that infest the woods and undergo
            gruesome mutations. They share a symbiotic link with the vipers,
            either transforming their arms to use them as whips or summoning
            gigantic serpents to devour victims.<span

          <p>
            Vicar Amelia is a high-ranking member of the Healing Church, the
            successor of Laurence, and to whom his Gold Pendant has been passed
            down. In stark contrast with the Beast Patients, people that slowly
            turn into monsters under layers of bandages, this woman shows
            perfectly what happens when a human mutates suddenly into a
            full-fledged Beast: at first Amelia is seen as a normal human woman
            with tattered white robes, kneeling and reciting a prayer, but after
            a few instants she changes abruptly. Her skin ruptures under the
            force of her new body, splattering blood all around her: now another
            kind of Cleric Beast, her ash blonde hair has become a long wild
            mane while her face, covered by scraps of her clothes like the rest
            of her body, has turned into a lupine head with thin antlers and a
            slasher smile of sharp teeth. The same Gold Pendant that she still
            clutches proves to be more than a simple locket: Amelia is able to
            use it to channel energy in order to start healing her wounds in a
            pillar of golden light, thus making it function similarly to a
            Hunter Tool.<span

            The Witch of Hemwick is visually an elderly hunched woman, with
            clothes that are covered head to toe in extracted human eyes. The
            Witch of Hemwick conducts suspicious rituals in the deep of the
            night, gathering the eyeballs of the living. Her outfit is adorned

          <p>
            Martyr Logarius was once the head of the Executioners, a fanatical
            partition of the Healing Church hunters, dedicated to the complete
            and utter destruction of the Cainhurst Vilebloods for their use of
            Old Blood that is, in their eyes, unholy and tainted. At some point,
            he discovered a "vile secret" within the castle, and took it upon
            himself to guard it from any who may try to uncover it. He donned
            the Crown of Illusions and sat himself upon his seat, to guard the
            place for eternity. He is mentioned in high regard by Alfred, who
            has the utmost adoration for him. Gehrman is later seen referring to
            Logarius and using the quote when discussing morality with a hunter.

            Mergo's Wet Nurse is a strange towering creature with six skeletal
            arms and two black tattered wings. Strangely enough, the appearance
            of this being appears to be rather Pthumerian, despite its bizarre
            features, with its long, black, hooded dress and various jewels.
            Mergo's Wet Nurse is a being that guards the infant Mergo, the
            source of the Nightmare of Mensis. Mergo is the child of Yharnam,
            who is standing outside the boss room. She will bow to the hunter if
            they go back the way they came after defeating Mergo's Wet
            Nurse.<span
